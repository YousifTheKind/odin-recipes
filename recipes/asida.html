    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="asida-color one">
        Asida is a common dish in the Arab world. It is a lump of dough, obtained by stirring wheat flour into boiling water, sometimes with added butter or honey.
    </p>
    <p class="asida-color two">
        Similar in texture to fufu, it is eaten mainly in Middle East and African countries.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Water</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="asida-color four">
        <li>
            Boil water in a large pot and add a pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually add sorghum flour (Dura) to the boiling water while continuously stirring to avoid lumps.

        </li>
        <li>
            Keep stirring and cooking the mixture over low heat until it thickens and forms a smooth, dough-like consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the mixture is cooked, remove it from the heat and shape it into a smooth, round mound using wet hands.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the Asida on a large platter and make a well in the center to hold a dollop of ghee or butter. It is traditionally eaten by tearing off a piece of the Asida, dipping it in the ghee, and then consuming it.
