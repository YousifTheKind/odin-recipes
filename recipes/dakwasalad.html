    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Dakwa salad is a refreshing and vibrant dish made with a mix of peanut butter with fresh and colorful vegetables, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, bell peppers, and red onions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The salad is typically tossed in a light and zesty vinaigrette dressing, which adds a tangy and flavorful element to the dish. Some variations of Dakwa salad may also include ingredients like olives, feta cheese, and herbs for added depth of flavor.
